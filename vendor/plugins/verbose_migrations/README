Verbose Migrations
==================

Verbose Migrations is a plugin that causes migrations to report what they are
doing, verbosely, to the console. By default, each migration will report it's
name, and whether it is being migrated (up) or reverted (down). Also, each
method missing call will be reported, with the name and arguments, so that
things like create_table and add_index are printed.

Benchmarks are also displayed, showing how long each operation took.

You can use the "say" method to report your own events, such as if you are
manipulating data directly using your own model classes:

  say "migrating data"
  Finances.update_all "amount=0", "account_id=7"

If you want to also show the benchmark for a custom event like this, you can
use "say_with_time":

  say_with_time "migrating data" do
    Finances.update_all "amount=0", "account_id=7"
  end

The output looks something like this:
